* MTD SPI driver for Micron MT29F (and similar) serial nand flash chips

Required properties:
- #address-cells, #size-cells : Must be present if the device has sub-nodes
  representing partitions.
- compatible : Should be "spinand,mt29f"
- reg : Chip-Select number
- spi-max-frequency : Maximum frequency of the SPI bus the chip can operate at

Example:

	spi-flash@0 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		compatible = "spinand,mt29f";
		reg = <0>; /* Chip select 0 */
		spi-max-frequency = <104000000>;
	};

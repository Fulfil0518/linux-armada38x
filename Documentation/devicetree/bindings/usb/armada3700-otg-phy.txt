USB Armada3700 OTG PHY

This controller is integrated only in Armada-3700.

Armada-3700 could be working in USB OTG mode which supports USB Host/Device mode
switching dynamically. To do that, the following dts changes are required:
- Enable both USB Host (usb3) and Device (u3d and udc) controller DT nodes.
- In USB Host DT node, use special XHCI driver compatible string:
  "marvell,armada-3700-xhci-otg", while the default one "generic-xhci" is for
  USB Host only mode.
- Enable OTG PHY TD node and make sure XHCI DT node have reference to it with
  "usb-phy" property.

Required properties:
- compatible	: should be "marvell,armada-3700-otg"
- reg		: Physical base address and size of the USB3 device registers map.
- interrupts	: Should contain single irq line of USB3 device controller

Optional properties:
- vcc-supply: phandle to the regulator that provides power to the PHY.

Example:
	usb3@58000 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-3700-xhci-otg";
		status = "okay";
		usb-phy = <&otg_phy>;
	};

	otg_phy: otg@5d800 {
		compatible = "marvell,usb-3700-otg";
		reg = <0x5d800 0x100>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 16 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		vcc-supply = <&exp_usb3_vbus>;
		status = "okay";
	};

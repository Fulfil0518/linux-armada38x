Marvell Armada AP806 System Controller
======================================

The AP806 is one of the two core HW blocks of the Marvell Armada 7K/8K
SoCs. It contains a system controller, which provides a number
registers giving access to numerous features: clocks, pin-muxing and
many other SoC configuration items. This DT binding allows to describe
this system controller.

The Device Tree node representing the AP806 system controller provides
a number of clocks:

 - 0: clock of CPU cluster 0
 - 1: clock of CPU cluster 1
 - 2: fixed PLL at 1200 Mhz
 - 3: MSS clock, derived from the fixed PLL
 - 4: eMMC clock, derived from the fixed PLL
 - 5: AP DCLK, derived from sample-at-reset configuration.
 - 6: AP ring clock. always double the DCLK
 - 7: AP external ring clock. half the ring clock.

Required properties:

 - compatible: must be:
     "marvell,ap806-system-controller", "syscon"
 - reg: register area of the AP806 system controller
 - #clock-cells: must be set to 1
 - clock-output-names: must be defined to:
   "ap-cpu-cluster-0", "ap-cpu-cluster-1", "ap-fixed", "ap-mss", "ap-emmc", "ap-dclk",
   "ap-rclk", "ap-ext-rclk"
Example:

	syscon: system-controller@6f4000 {
		compatible = "marvell,ap806-system-controller", "syscon";
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		clock-output-names = "ap-cpu-cluster-0", "ap-cpu-cluster-1",
				     "ap-fixed", "ap-mss", "ap-emmc", "dp-hclk",
				     "ap-rclk", "ap-ext-rclk";
		reg = <0x6f4000 0x1000>;
	};

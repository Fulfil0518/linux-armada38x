* Clock bindings for Marvell MVEBU AP806 CPU clock

The Marvell MVEBU Armada 7K/8K SoCs contains a block called AP806,
hosting the CPU and other core components of the CPU.
This Device Tree binding allows to describe the AP806 CPU clock settings
and CPU mapping of the AP806, whose frequencies are determined by
reading the Sample-At-Reset (SAR)register.

NOTE:
When ap806_clock node is enabled, and CPU clock driver initialized
successfully, it will also register and enable the cpufreq-dt generic
driver for CPU frequency scaling.


Required properties for ap806_clock node:
- compatible: must be be the following:
	"marvell,ap806-cpu-clk", "syscon"
- reg: must be the register address of the CPU Dynamic Frequency Base
	Scaling register base (which is the Sample-At-Reset (SAR) register base)
- #clock-cells: from common clock binding; shall be set to 1
- #clock: pointer to "ap-cpu-cluster-0" clock entry in ap806-system-controller node

Required properties for CPU nodes:
- clocks: a list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs to ap806_clock,
		one for each CPU node.

Example:
	cpu0: cpu@000 {
		..
		clocks = <&ap806_clock 0>;
		..
	};
	cpu1: cpu@001 {
		..
		clocks = <&ap806_clock 0>;
		..
	};
	cpu2: cpu@100 {
		..
		clocks = <&ap806_clock 1>;
		..
	};
	cpu3: cpu@101 {
		..
		clocks = <&ap806_clock 1>;
		..
	};

	ap806_clock: ap806_clock {
		compatible = "marvell,ap806-cpu-clk", "syscon";
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		clocks = <&ap_syscon 0>;
		reg = <0x6f8200 0x100>;
	};

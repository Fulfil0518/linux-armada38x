Marvell EBU Comphy binding
==========================

This binding describes a Comphy device that is used to control
and configure comphy hardware on Marvell SoCs.

Each Comphy device has several PHYs which can be configured
to support various modes:
SATA, USB, PCIE, Network modes, etc.

Required properties for comphy node:
	- compatible:	Should be "marvell,cp110-comphy"
	- reg:			Address and length of register sets
				    for each device in "reg-names"
	- reg-names:	The names of the register addresses
					corresponding to the registers filled in "reg".
	- #phy-cells:	Standard property (Documentation: phy-bindings.txt)
					Should be 2.
	Example will be provided in the end of this file.

Each device using Comphy should have handle with the following properties:
	- Handle to the Comphy node.
	- Comphy index (SerDes lane number).
	- Required Comphy mode (SATA/PCIE/USB/Network).
	Example will be provided in the end of this file.

Example:
Comphy Node:
============
		comphy0: comphy {
				compatible = "marvell,cp110-comphy";
				reg = <0x441000 0x100>, <0x120000 0x6000>;
				reg-names = "comphy", "serdes";
				#phy-cells = <2>;
				status = "okay";
		};

		comphy1: comphy {
				compatible = "marvell,cp110-comphy";
				reg = <0x441000 0x100>, <0x120000 0x6000>;
				reg-names = "comphy", "serdes";
				#phy-cells = <2>;
				status = "okay";
		};

Comphy consumer:
=============
		sata@540000 {
				phys = <&comphy0 4 COMPHY_SATA0>;
				status = "okay";
		};

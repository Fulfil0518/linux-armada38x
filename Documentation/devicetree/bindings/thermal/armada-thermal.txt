* Marvell Armada 370/375/380/XP/70x0/80x0 thermal management

Required properties:

- compatible:	Should be set to one of the following:
		marvell,armada370-thermal
		marvell,armada375-thermal
		marvell,armada380-thermal
		marvell,armadaxp-thermal
		marvell,armada-ap806-thermal
		marvell,armada-cp110-thermal

- reg:		Device's register space.
		Two or three entries are expected, see the examples below.
		The first one is required for the sensor register;
		the second one is required for the control register
		to be used for sensor initialization (a.k.a. calibration).
		The third entry is dedicated to the DFX interrupt for
		Armada 38x.

- interrupts:	Should contain interrupt for thermal system
or
- interrupts-extended:
		Should contain parent node and interrupt for thermal system
		(relevant for devices with irq-chip).

- threshold:	Temperature threshold in Celsius, the threshold +/- calculated
		hysteresis (formula below) define the upper and lower watermark
		which when crossing, an interrupt will be asserted.

- hysteresis:	Valid values are 0..3, following is upper/lower watermark calculation:
		high/low watermark = threshold +/- 0.4761 * 2^(hysteresis + 2).
		Following are the corresponding degrees corresponding to
		hysteresis value: 0=>1.9, 1=>3.8,  2=>7.6, 3=>15.2

Example for a38x:

	thermal@e4078 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada380-thermal";
		reg = <0xe4078 0x4>,
		      <0xe4074 0x4>,
		      <0xe4100 0x20>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 78 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		threshold = <100>;
		hysteresis = <2>;
		status = "okay";
	};

or Example for Armada-7040 (with irq-chip):

	thermal@400078 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-cp110-thermal";
		reg = <0x400078 0x4>,
		      <0x400070 0x8>,
		      <0x400100 0x20>;
		interrupts-extended = <&sei 37>;
		threshold = <100>;
		hysteresis = <2>;
		status = "okay";
	}

Porting Guide for Marvell SoCs
==============================

This document provides instructions for porting Marvell Linux package
to a customer's board.

Relevant Devices
----------------
	- Armada-80x0
	- Armada-70x0
	- Armada-37x0
	- Armada-38x
	- Armada-39x

Introduction
------------
The device-tree includes runtime configuration for the Linux Kernel.
In addition, the device-tree enables passing configuration parameters to drivers.

For general information about the device-tree please refer to:
http://elinux.org/Device_Tree

Device-tree files
-----------------
Marvell's device-tree files are located in the following locations:
- arch/arm64/boot/dts/marvell for 64-bit devices (A37x0, A80x0 and A70x0)
- arch/arm/boot/dts for 32-bit devices (A38x and A39x).

Marvell device-trees consists of 2 types of file:
	- *.dtsi - These files represents the SoC. Each available interface
		   has a node which holds the SoC information.
	- *.dts  - These files holds the configuration of the board itself,
		   enabling/disabling nodes from SoCs, adding board information
		   to each node (if required).

Porting procedure
-----------------
	1. Choose one of the following example device-trees (for the SoC in use):
		- arch/arm64/boot/dts/marvell/armada-80x0-customer.dts
		- arch/arm64/boot/dts/marvell/armada-70x0-customer.dts
		- arch/arm64/boot/dts/marvell/armada-37x0-customer.dts
		- arch/arm/boot/dts/marvell/armada-38x-customer.dts	/* TODO - generate */
		- arch/arm/boot/dts/marvell/armada-39x-customer.dts	/* TODO - generate */

		Copy the selected file, change the name and place the file in the correct folder, for example:
		- "/arch/arm64/boot/dts/marvell/armada-8040-<new_name>.dts"
		- "./arch/arm/boot/dts/armada-38x-<new_name>.dts"

	2. Add the new device-tree file to the corresponding Makefile:
		- ./arch/arm64/boot/dts/marvell/Makefile (A80x0, A70x0, A37x0)
		- ./arch/arm/boot/dts/Makefile		 (A38x, A39x)

		For example:
		"dtb-$(CONFIG_ARCH_MVEBU) += armada-8040-<new_name>.dtb"

	3. Look for "UPDATE" comments in the device tree and update board
	   specific information:
		- Model: "Customer board model"
		- Compatible: "customer-board-compatible"
		- Memory size: Update "memory" node properties
		- MPPs: pinctrl-0 = <handle>
		- PHY addresses for network nodes
		- COMPHY handles for network nodes
		- SPI flash (if needed)
		- I2c devices (if needed)


Device-Tree Bindings
====================
In order to make the porting of the drivers easier, each Linux driver
has a device tree binding document which explains the usage of the driver.
All binding documents are located in: Documentation/devicetree/bindings.

The tables below list the binding documents for Marvell's drivers.
